# arch-wiki-terminal
A helpful little script that will pull from the Arch wiki, right in your terminal!

### Installation
Either use a pre-compiled executable, or set up a Python virtual environment using the `requirements.txt` file.

### Using the script
Usage is very simple, run it through a terminal. You're prompted with an input to search the wiki (ex: pyhton, i3, linux). After results are found, you're prompted to select a chapter in the table of contents.
