# Installation
Either use a pre-compiled executable, or set up a Python virtual environment using the `requirements.txt` file.

# Usage
Usage is very simple, run it through a terminal. You're prompted with an input to search the wiki (ex: pyhton, i3, linux). After results are found, you're prompted to select a chapter in the table of contents.
